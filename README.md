# Charitron

## Inspiration
Charitron is based on helping people in need who dont want to ask for handouts, so a smart charitable vending machine

## What it does
A smart charitable vending machine: a person can buy something from the vending machine, and can then  also pay for some needy person to be able to obtain an item for free from the machine.
This is a system where a needy user can register online with their details and send a request to be approved. once they are reviewed and approved, they can approach a charitron vending machine, and if there has been a donation payment made, they can verify their identity with face recognition and the charitron will dispense the free item!

##Admin Dashboard
After logging in as admin, you can see user's name, age, gender, email and their note talking their need. After verifying their claim the admin can approve or deny the request. You can look at approved requests, pending requests, and also adjust based on the time period.

## How I built it
hardware:
arduino
motors
raspberry pi
pi camera

software
python
html
javascript
C


## Challenges I ran into
getting the hardware to actually work like a vending machine


## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
the system works!


## What I learned
working across the globe in timezones is difficult


## What's next for Charitron
better prototype
more UI/UX
more options
